# Trip-Advisor-RNN

This is a Academic project where datasets were taken from Trip Advisor and Recurrent Neural Network was implemented to predict the __Sentiments of Customers__ based on their feedback on a particular hotel. Following different sentiment labels were used in the predicition process:
- _Positive_
- _Negative_
- _Neutral_

The labels were separated according to the review provided by the customer. Also the model was compiled using *categorical_crossentropy*, *adam optimzer* to optimize the model and *softmax* activation function and each time the accuracy of the model was increased.
